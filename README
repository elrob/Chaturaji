Imperial Chaturaji Group Project

Still a work in progress preparing it for public use.

I designed and produced most of the UI.
I have since gone through a lot of the server code.

Use still relies on WebSockets (which some browsers still don't support) but I have a plan to migrate to the Atmosphere framework to avoid this.
